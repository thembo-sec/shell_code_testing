# Simple Shell Code Dropper

Tooling around with comparisons to C v Rust shellcode droppers. Currently a super simple dropper that just executes /bin/sh on a target linux system.

Curious to see how EDR would respond to either of these files.

## TODO

Considering building out functionality for different target OS.
